# Hardhat
Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. It is written in JavaScript language.

## Hardhat vs Truffle
Hardhat: 
- Faster migration process.
- Has low gas consumption
- Debugging is easy

## Hardhat Installation
To install hardhat:

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat (choose JavaScript project)

```
After this install the dependencies that are listed by the hardhat as additional dependencies.

## Hardhat Compilation

Now make contracts in the **contracts folder** of the hardhat. Use the following command to first compile the contract.

```
cd contracts
npx hardhat compile
```
## Hardhat Contract Testing
Then run the tests in the test folder, while use the script folder to deploy the contract on the testnet.
For testing use command:

`npx hardhat test`

## Hardhat Contract Debugging
First import the following file in the test. Then write the statements and then check using following.

```
import "hardhat/console.sol"
npx hardhat test

```

## Hardhat Contract Deployment
First write deployment code in the deploy folder. In the deploy script, this code is universal:
```
main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
  });

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Hardhat Contract Deployment on testnet
First use the alchemy, to take the GOERLI (chain) URL and API_KEY and save them in .env file, using names:
```
GOERLI_URL
GOERLI_API_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY (from Metamask wallet)
```
And in hardhat config.js, run following:
```
require("dotenv").config();

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
const GOERLI_URL = process.env.GOERLI_URL;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.17", [use lastest version]
  networks: {
    goerli: {
      url: GOERLI_URL,
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

Also, remember to first install .env package in the project and then include this:
```
npm i dotenv
GOERLI_URL=[URL_FROM_ALCHEMY]
GOERLI_API_KEY= [API_KEY_FROM_ALCHEMY]
PRIVATE_KEY= [wallet PRIVATE_KEY]

```

Then run following command, to deploy on the testnet
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

Check the address of the contact on the [goerli etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/), by pasting token address.
